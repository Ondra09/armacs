These are the switches that get passed to ls when dired gets a list of files. We’re using:

    l: Use the long listing format.
    h: Use human-readable sizes.
    v: Sort numbers naturally.
    A: Almost all. Doesn’t include ”.” or ”..”.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default dired-listing-switches "-lhvA")
#+END_SRC

Kill buffers of files/directories that are deleted in dired.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq dired-clean-up-buffers-too t)
#+END_SRC

Always copy directories recursively instead of asking every time.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq dired-recursive-copies 'always)
#+END_SRC

Ask before recursively deleting a directory, though.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq dired-recursive-deletes 'top)
#+END_SRC
