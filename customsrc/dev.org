* Brackets using electric
If you write any code, you may enjoy this. Typing the first character in a set of 2, completes the second one after your cursor. Opening a bracket? It’s closed for you already. Quoting something? It’s closed for you already. You can easily add and remove pairs yourself, have a look.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq electric-pair-pairs '(
                           (?\{ . ?\})
                           (?\( . ?\))
                           (?\[ . ?\])
                           (?\" . ?\")
                           ))

* Semantic Selection
So what this package does is it select text in way that's sensibe towards the syntax. So for example if I'm in a html tag that is the child of another tag, invoking the keybinding for this package will first select the child then the parent and hierarchichally move upwards. No need to drag the mouse around, this is selection done sensibly.

(use-package expand-region
  :bind ("C-=" . er/expand-region))
